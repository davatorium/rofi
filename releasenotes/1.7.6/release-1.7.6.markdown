# 1.7.6: Traveling Time

## Recursive file browser

An experimental file browser is introduced in this version.
This recursively scans through the users home directory (this is configurable) to find files.
It is designed to be asynchronous and very fast.

The following settings can be configured:

```css
configuration {
   recursivebrowser {
      /** Directory the file browser starts in. */
      directory: "/some/directory";
      /** return 1 on cancel. */
      cancel‐returns‐1: true;
      /** filter entries using regex */
      filter‐regex: "(.*cache.*|.*.o)";
      /** command */
      command: "xdg‐open";
   }
}
```

A thumbnail generation mechanism is also supported if `-show-icons` is enabled.
See details and setup in the `rofi-thumbnails(5)` man page. Thanks to giomatfois62 for
bringing this feature to life!

## Copy to clipboard support

Add support to copy current selected item to clipboard.
The added `control-c` binding copies the current selection to the clipboard.

**THIS ONLY WORKS WITH CLIPBOARD MANAGER!!!** Once rofi is closed, the data is
gone!

## Entry box history

You can now recall and move through previous queries by using
`kb-entry-history-up` or 'kb-entry-history-down` keys. (`Control-Up`,
`Control-Down`).

The following settings can be configured:

```css
configuration {
    entry  {
        max‐history: 30;
    }
}
```

## Fix calc

There was a non-parsable grammar in the 'calc' part of the language.
The % operator (modulo) overloaded with percent and could leave to statements
having multiple valid but contradicting interpretations.
To resolve this the modulo operator is now `modulo`.

Several smaller issues with the parser were also fixed in this patch.

## Text and cursor outline

Three new properties were added to textbox widgets to control text outline:

* `text-outline` boolean to enable outlines
* `text-outline-width` to control size
* `text-outline-color` to control color

![Outlines](./text-outline.png)

Outlines can also be added to cursors, via similarly named
properties (`cursor-outline-*`).

## Dependencies and packaging

In this version, we have bumped the minimal required versions of some
dependencies to keep up with bugs and deprecations while staying compatible
with long-term supported distributions.

* glib: 2.72 or newer
* meson: 0.59.0 or newer

This roughly corresponds to Ubuntu 22.04 Jammy and Debian Bookworm.

Generated man pages were removed from the git repository and now require
`pandoc` to build instead of `go-md2man`. If you compile from git, you
will now need to install `pandoc` to get the man pages.

Release tarballs still contain the files and can be installed without
additional tool.

## Known issues

* `new-selection` is not working for values exceeding the number of rows in previous run. (#2037)

## Other smaller changes

* new `.rasinc` extension for theme fragments included from other theme files
* `-ellipsize-mode` mode option in dmenu mode can be set to `start`, `middle` or `end`
  to control how long entries are ellipsized
* `-list-keybindings` to print a summary of configured bindings
* `-window-prefer-icon-theme` to force precedence of theme icons over applications'
  custom ones (#1702)
* `-placeholder-markup` to enable pango markup when rendering placeholder text (#1690)
* `urgent` and `active` flags can be controlled for each row in dmenu and script
  modes
* `-transient-window-mode` to make rofi react like a modal dialog that is transient to
  the currently focused window.
* Fixing window coordinates for non-reparting window manager. (Thanks to Ortango #1969)
* Fix failing decode of animated gif files. (Thanks to martinsifrar #1975)
