# 1.6.0: The Masked Launcher

More then 2 years after the 1.5.0 release and a year after 1.5.4, we present rofi 1.6.0. This release
is again focusses bug-fixing and improving the experience for themers and
script developers. The script mode has been extended with many small requested tweaks to get it more
on par with dmenu mode. For themers the listview has been made more flexible, allowing more fancy themes,
for examples mimicking Gnomes application launcher or [albert](https://github.com/albertlauncher/albert).

Big thanks to [SardemFF7](https://www.sardemff7.net/) and all the other
contributors, without their support and contributions this release would not
have been possible.


## Script mode

Rofi now communicates some information back to the script using environment variables.
The most important one, is `ROFI_RETV`, this is equal to the return value in dmenu mode.
It can have the following values:

 * **0**: Initial call of script.
 * **1**: Selected an entry.
 * **2**: Selected a custom entry.
 * **10-28**: Custom keybinding 1-19


To fully read up on all features of script mode, there is now a `rofi-script(5)` manpage.

Some of the new features are:

 * Search invisible text
 * Pass extra information back on selection
 * Support for a custom delimiter
 * Support for dmenus no-custom option
 * Detect if launched from rofi


To test some of the features:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

if [ -z "${ROFI_OUTSIDE}" ]
then
    echo "run this script in rofi".
    exit
fi

echo -en "\x00no-custom\x1ftrue\n"
echo -en "${ROFI_RETV}\x00icon\x1ffirefox\x1finfo\x1ftest\n"

if [ -n "${ROFI_INFO}" ]
then
    echo "my info: ${ROFI_INFO} "
fi
```


## Theme

There have been a set of tweaks to the theme format, making it more flexible and hopefully more themer-friendly.


### Listview flexibility

This is one of the biggest change, instead of the listview having a hacked
textbox as elements. It now re-uses existing widgets like box, icon and
textbox.  This way you can re-structure how it looks. For example put the icon
above the text.


![Icons](./icons.png)

With theme:

```css
element {
  orientation: vertical;
}
```

This will make the box `element` put `element-icon` and `element-text` in a vertical list.

or change the ordering to show icon on the right:

```css
element {
  children: [element-text, element-icon];
}
```

![Icons vertical](./icons2.png)


![icon warning](./warning.png)
This causes a breaking change for themes, to modify the highlighting, this should be set to `element-text`.
Or inherited. `element-text { highlight: inherit; }`.

### Calculation support in theme format.

Rofi adds CSS like calculations in the CSS format for distances.
You can now set the width of the window to the screen width minus a 10 pixels.

```css
window {
    width: calc(100% - 10px);
}
```

It supports: `-`, `+`, `/`, `*` and `%` operators and they should be surrounded by whitespace.


### Initial media support

This is a very initial implementation of CSS like `@media` support. This allows you to modify the theme
based on screen size or ratio.

We currently support: minimum width, minimum height, maximum width, maximum
height, monitor id, minimum aspect ratio or maximum aspect ratio.


For example, go to fullscreen mode on screens smaller then full HD:

```
@media (max-width: 1920 ) {
  window {
    fullscreen: true;
  }
}
```
