# 1.7.2: Shellebrations! 

A quick in between release, a bug got fixed that caused configurations not working any more in theme files.
While this is the desired behaviour, this release reverts it to avoid breaking to many setups.

# Changelog

v1.7.2:
   - [Build] Fix building without window mode enabled.
   - [Config] Do not print out the 'theme' field in configuration on dump.
   - [CI] test window mode less build.
   - Allow configuration block in theme again.
