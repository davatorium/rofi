.SH NAME
.PP
\fBrofi\fP - A window switcher, application launcher, ssh dialog, dmenu replacement and more

.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBrofi\fP [ -show \fImode\fP ]|[ -dmenu ]|[ -e \fImsg\fP ] [ CONFIGURATION ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBrofi\fP is an X11 pop-up window switcher, run dialog, dmenu replacement, and
more. It focuses on being fast to use and have minimal distraction. It supports
keyboard and mouse navigation, type to filter, tokenized search and more.

.SH USAGE
.PP
\fBrofi\fP\&'s main functionality is to assist in your workflow, allowing you to
quickly switch between windows, start applications or log into a remote machine
via \fB\fCssh\fR\&. There are different \fImodes\fP for different types of actions. \fBrofi\fP
is a standalone application and should not be integrated into scripts. For
integration into scripts it has a special mode that functions as a (drop-in)
replacement for \fBdmenu(1)\fP\&. See emulating dmenu below.

.SS Running rofi
.PP
To launch \fBrofi\fP directly in a certain mode, specify a mode with \fB\fCrofi -show <mode>\fR\&.
To show the \fB\fCdrun\fR dialog:

.PP
.RS

.nf
    rofi -show drun

.fi
.RE

.PP
A very useful setup in minimalistic window managers is to combine \fB\fCdrun\fR, \fB\fCrun\fR
with \fB\fCwindow\fR mode:

.PP
.RS

.nf
  rofi -show combi -modes combi -combi-modes "window,drun,run"

.fi
.RE

.PP
In this setup it first list all open applications, then all installed
applications. So if you type firefox and hit return, it will switch to the
running firefox, or launch it when it is not running.

.SS Emulating dmenu
.PP
\fBrofi\fP can emulate \fBdmenu(1)\fP (a dynamic menu for X11) when launched with
the \fB\fC-dmenu\fR flag.

.PP
For more information see \fBrofi-dmenu(5)\fP\&.

.SS Display Error message
.PP
\fBrofi\fP error dialog can also be called from the command line.

.PP
.RS

.nf
rofi -e "my message"

.fi
.RE

.PP
Markup support can be enabled, see CONFIGURATION options.

.SH CONFIGURATION
.PP
There are currently three methods of setting configuration options (evaluated in order below):

.RS
.IP \(bu 2
System configuration file  (for example \fB\fC/etc/rofi.rasi\fR).
It first checks \fB\fCXDG_CONFIG_DIRS\fR, and then \fB\fCSYSCONFDIR\fR (that is passed at compile time).
It loads the first config file it finds, it does not merge multiple system configuration files.
.IP \(bu 2
Rasi theme file: The new \fItheme\fP format can be used to set configuration values.
.IP \(bu 2
Command-line options: Arguments passed to \fBrofi\fP\&.

.RE

.PP
To get a template config file, run: \fB\fCrofi -dump-config > config.rasi\fR

.PP
This will contain (commented) all current configuration options, modified options are uncommented.

.PP
To get a template config file that sets the icon-theme run: \fB\fCrofi -icon-theme hicolor -dump-config\fR\&.

.PP
It is \fBstrongly\fP recommended to use this as a starting point for your configuration.

.PP
An empty configuration section in the config file looks like:

.PP
.RS

.nf
configuration {
 // set config options here
}

.fi
.RE

.PP
Most of the configuration options mentioned below (beside options like \fB\fC-show\fR,
\fB\fC-dump-config\fR that apply to a single run) can be set here.

.PP
For example to set the dpi value to 72:

.PP
.RS

.nf
configuration {
	dpi: 72;
}

.fi
.RE

.PP
The configuration system supports the following types:

.RS
.IP \(bu 2
string
.IP \(bu 2
integer (signed and unsigned)
.IP \(bu 2
char
.IP \(bu 2
boolean
.IP \(bu 2
lists

.RE

.PP
For the syntax of these options, see the \fBrofi-theme(5)\fP manpage.

.PP
For use on the command line, Boolean options have a non-default command-line
syntax. Example to enable option X:

.PP
.RS

.nf
-X

.fi
.RE

.PP
To disable option X:

.PP
.RS

.nf
-no-X

.fi
.RE

.PP
Below is a list of the most important options:

.SS General
.PP
\fB\fC-help\fR

.PP
The help option shows the full list of command-line options and the current set
values. These include dynamic (run-time generated) options.

.PP
Try to parse the file and return 0 when successful, non-zero when failed.

.PP
\fB\fC-list-keybindings\fR

.PP
List all known keybindings without trying to parse them. This can be used to
look for duplicate bindings.

.PP
\fB\fC-threads\fR \fInum\fP

.PP
Specify the number of threads \fBrofi\fP should use:

.RS
.IP \(bu 2
0: Autodetect the number of supported hardware threads.
.IP \(bu 2
1: Disable threading
.IP \(bu 2
2..n: Specify the maximum number of threads to use in the thread pool.Default:  Autodetect

.RE

.PP
\fB\fC-display\fR \fIdisplay\fP

.PP
The X server to contact. Default is \fB\fC$DISPLAY\fR\&.

.PP
\fB\fC-dmenu\fR

.PP
Run \fBrofi\fP in dmenu mode. This allows for interactive scripts.
In \fB\fCdmenu\fR mode, \fBrofi\fP reads from STDIN, and output to STDOUT.
A simple example, displaying three pre-defined options:

.PP
.RS

.nf
echo -e "Option #1\\nOption #2\\nOption #3" | rofi -dmenu

.fi
.RE

.PP
Or get the options from a script:

.PP
.RS

.nf
~/my_script.sh | rofi -dmenu

.fi
.RE

.PP
See the \fBrofi-dmenu(5)\fP manpage for more information.

.PP
\fB\fC-show\fR \fImode\fP

.PP
Open \fBrofi\fP in a certain mode. Available modes are \fB\fCwindow\fR, \fB\fCrun\fR, \fB\fCdrun\fR,
\fB\fCssh\fR, \fB\fCcombi\fR\&. The special argument \fB\fCkeys\fR can be used to open a searchable
list of supported key bindings
(see the \fBrofi-keys(5)\fP manpage)

.PP
To show the run-dialog:

.PP
.RS

.nf
rofi -show run

.fi
.RE

.PP
If \fB\fC-show\fR is the last option passed to rofi, the first enabled modes is shown.

.PP
\fB\fC-modes\fR \fImode1,mode2\fP

.PP
Specify an ordered, comma-separated list of modes to enable.
Enabled modes can be changed at runtime. Default key is \fB\fCCtrl+Tab\fR\&.
If no modes are specified, all configured modes will be enabled.
To only show the \fB\fCrun\fR and \fB\fCssh\fR launcher:

.PP
.RS

.nf
rofi -modes "run,ssh" -show run

.fi
.RE

.PP
Custom modes can be added using the internal \fB\fCscript\fR mode. Each such mode has
two parameters:

.PP
.RS

.nf
<name>:<script>

.fi
.RE

.PP
Example: Have a mode called 'Workspaces' using the \fB\fCi3_switch_workspaces.sh\fR script:

.PP
.RS

.nf
rofi -modes "window,run,ssh,Workspaces:i3_switch_workspaces.sh" -show Workspaces

.fi
.RE

.PP
Notes: The i3 window manager dislikes commas in the command when specifying an
exec command. For that case, \fB\fC#\fR can be used as a separator.

.PP
\fBTIP\fP: The name is allowed to contain spaces:

.PP
.RS

.nf
rofi -modes "My File Browser:fb.sh" -show "My File Browser"

.fi
.RE

.SS Layout and Theming
.PP
\fBIMPORTANT:\fP
  In newer \fBrofi\fP releases, all the theming options have been moved into the new theme format. They are no longer normal
  \fBrofi\fP options that can be passed directly on the command line (there are too many).
  Small snippets can be passed on the command line: \fB\fCrofi -theme-str 'window {width: 50%;}'\fR to override a single
  setting. They are merged into the current theme.
  They can also be appended at the end of the \fBrofi\fP config file to override parts of the theme.

.PP
Most of the following options are \fBdeprecated\fP and should not be used. Please use the new theme format to customize

.SH Available Modes
.SS window
.PP
Show a list of all the windows and allow switching between them.
Pressing the \fB\fCdelete-entry\fR binding (\fB\fCshift-delete\fR) will close the window.
Pressing the \fB\fCaccept-custom\fR binding (\fB\fCcontrol-enter\fR or \fB\fCshift-enter\fR) will run a command on the window.
(See option \fB\fCwindow-command\fR );

.PP
If there is no match, it will try to launch the input.

.SS windowcd
.PP
Shows a list of the windows on the current desktop and allows switching between them.
Pressing the \fB\fCdelete-entry\fR binding (\fB\fCshift-delete\fR) will kill the window.
Pressing the \fB\fCaccept-custom\fR binding (\fB\fCcontrol-enter\fR or \fB\fCshift-enter\fR) will run a command on the window.
(See option \fB\fCwindow-command\fR );

.PP
If there is no match, it will try to launch the input.

.SS run
.PP
Shows a list of executables in \fB\fC$PATH\fR and can launch them (optional in a terminal).
Pressing the \fB\fCdelete-entry\fR binding (\fB\fCshift-delete\fR) will remove this entry from the run history.
Pressing the \fB\fCaccept-custom\fR binding (\fB\fCcontrol-enter\fR) will run the command as entered in the entry box.
Pressing the \fB\fCaccept-alt\fR binding (\fB\fCshift-enter\fR) will run the command in a terminal.

.PP
When pressing the \fB\fCmode-complete\fR binding (\fB\fCControl-l\fR), you can use the File Browser mode to launch the application
with a file as the first argument.

.SS drun
.PP
Same as the \fBrun\fP launches, but the list is created from the installed desktop files. It automatically launches them
in a terminal if specified in the Desktop File.
Pressing the \fB\fCdelete-entry\fR binding (\fB\fCshift-delete\fR) will remove this entry from the run history.
Pressing the \fB\fCaccept-custom\fR binding (\fB\fCcontrol-enter\fR) will run the command as entered in the entry box.
Pressing the \fB\fCaccept-alt\fR binding (\fB\fCshift-enter\fR) will run the command in a terminal.

.PP
When pressing the \fB\fCmode-complete\fR binding (\fB\fCControl-l\fR), you can use the File Browser mode to launch the application
passing a file as argument if specified in the desktop file.

.PP
The DRUN mode tries to follow the XDG Desktop Entry
Specification
\[la]https://freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/desktop-entry-spec/\[ra] and should be compatible with
applications using this standard.  Some applications create invalid desktop files, \fBrofi\fP will discard these entries.
See the debugging section for more info on DRUN mode, this will print why desktop files are
discarded.

.PP
There are two advanced options to tweak the behaviour:

.PP
.RS

.nf
configuration {
   drun {
      /** Parse user desktop files. */
      parse-user:   true;
      /** Parse system desktop files. */
      parse-system: false;

.SS ssh
.PP
Shows a list of SSH targets based on your \fB\fCssh\fR config file, and allows to quickly \fB\fCssh\fR into them.

.SS keys
.PP
Shows a searchable list of key bindings.

.SS script
.PP
Allows custom scripted Modes to be added, see the \fBrofi-script(5)\fP manpage for more information.

.SS combi
.PP
Combines multiple modes in one list. Specify which modes are included with the \fB\fC-combi-modes\fR option.

.PP
When using the combi mode, a \fI!bang\fP can be used to filter the results by modes.
All modes that match the bang as a prefix are included.
For example, say you have specified \fB\fC-combi-modes run,window,windowcd\fR\&. If your
query begins with the bang \fB\fC!w\fR, only results from the \fB\fCwindow\fR and \fB\fCwindowcd\fR
modes are shown, even if the rest of the input text would match results from \fB\fCrun\fR\&.

.PP
If no match, the input is handled by the first combined modes.

.SH FAQ
.SS The text in the window switcher is not nicely aligned.
.PP
Try using a mono-space font or tabs + the tab-stops setting..

.SS The window is completely black.

.RE

.SS Why do I see different icons for run,drun and window mode
.PP
Each of these modes uses different methods of resolving the icon:

.RS
.IP \(bu 2
Window: It first uses the icon that the application exposes via the X11
Server, if none is set it does a lookup of the window Class name in the icon theme.
.IP \(bu 2
drun: It uses the icon set in the desktop file.
.IP \(bu 2
run: It does a lookup using the executable name.

Some tools (such as \fB\fCimport\fR or \fB\fCxdotool\fR) might be unable to run upon a KeyPress event, because the keyboard/pointer is
still grabbed. For these situations, the \fB\fC--release\fR flag can be used, as it will execute the command after the keys have
