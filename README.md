<h1 align="center"> Rofi </h1>
<p align="center"><i>A window switcher, Application launcher and dmenu replacement</i>.</p>

**Rofi** started as a clone of simpleswitcher, written by [Sean
Pringle](http://github.com/seanpringle/simpleswitcher) - a popup window
switcher roughly based on
[superswitcher](http://code.google.com/p/superswitcher/). Simpleswitcher laid
the foundations, and therefore Sean Pringle deserves most of the credit for
this tool. **Rofi** (renamed, as it lost the *simple* property) has been
extended with extra features, like an application launcher and ssh-launcher,
and can act as a drop-in dmenu replacement, making it a very versatile tool.

**Rofi**, like dmenu, will provide the user with a textual list of options
where one or more can be selected.
This can either be running an application, selecting a window, or options
provided by an external script.

### What is rofi not?

Rofi is not:

-   A UI toolkit.

-   A library to be used in other applications.

-   An application that can support every possible use-case. It tries to be
    generic enough to be usable by everybody.
    - Specific functionality can be added using scripts or plugins, many exists.

-   Just a dmenu replacement. The dmenu functionality is a nice 'extra' to
    **rofi**, not its main purpose.

## Installation

Please see the [installation
guide](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi/blob/next/INSTALL.md) for
instructions on how to install **Rofi**.

## Quickstart

### Usage

> **This section just gives a brief overview of the various options. To get the
> full set of options see the [manpages](#manpage) section above**

#### Running rofi

To launch **rofi** directly in a certain mode, specify a mode with `rofi -show <mode>`.
To show the `run` dialog:

```bash
    rofi -show run
```

Or get the options from a script:

```bash
    ~/my_script.sh | rofi -dmenu
```

Specify an ordered, comma-separated list of modes to enable. Enabled modes can
be changed at runtime. Default key is `Ctrl+Tab`. If no modes are specified,
all configured modes will be enabled. To only show the `run` and `ssh`
launcher:

```bash
    rofi -modes "run,ssh" -show run
```

The modes to combine in combi mode.
For syntax to `-combi-modes `, see `-modes`.
To get one merge view, of `window`,`run`, and `ssh`:

```bash
	rofi -show combi -combi-modes "window,run,ssh" -modes combi
```

### Configuration

Generate a default configuration file

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/rofi
rofi -dump-config > ~/.config/rofi/config.rasi
```

This creates a file called `config.rasi` in the `~/.config/rofi/` folder. You
can modify this file to set configuration settings and modify themes.
`config.rasi` is the file rofi looks to by default.

Please see the [configuration
guide](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi/blob/next/CONFIG.md) for a summary of
configuration options. More detailed options are provided in the manpages.
