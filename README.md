<p align="center"><i>A window switcher, Application launcher and dmenu replacement</i>.</p>

**Rofi** started as a clone of simpleswitcher, written by [Sean Pringle](http://github.com/seanpringle/simpleswitcher) - a
popup window switcher roughly based on [superswitcher](http://code.google.com/p/superswitcher/).
Simpleswitcher laid the foundations, and therefore Sean Pringle deserves most of the credit for this tool. **Rofi**
(renamed, as it lost the *simple* property) has been extended with extra features, like an application launcher and
ssh-launcher, and can act as a drop-in dmenu replacement, making it a very versatile tool.

**Rofi**, like dmenu, will provide the user with a textual list of options where one or more can be selected.
This can either be running an application, selecting a window, or options provided by an external script.


## What is rofi not?

Rofi is not:

*   A UI toolkit.
*   A library to be used in other applications.
*   An application that can support every possible use-case. It tries to be generic enough to be usable by everybody.
    * Specific functionality can be added using scripts or plugins, many exists.
*   Just a dmenu replacement. The dmenu functionality is a nice 'extra' to **rofi**, not its main purpose.

# Installation

Please see the [installation guide](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi/blob/next/INSTALL.md) for instructions on how to
install **Rofi**.

# Quickstart

## Usage

> **This section just gives a brief overview of the various options. To get the full set of options see the _manpages_ section above**

#### Running rofi

To launch **rofi** directly in a certain [modi(modes)](#modi), specify a mode with `rofi -show <modi>`.
To show the `run` dialog:

    rofi -show run

Or get the options from a script:

    ~/my_script.sh | rofi -dmenu

Specify an ordered, comma-separated list of modes to enable.
Enabled modes can be changed at runtime. Default key is `Ctrl+Tab`.
If no modes are specified, all configured modes will be enabled.
To only show the `run` and `ssh` launcher:

    rofi -modi "run,ssh" -show run
The list of modes can also be `#` separated. The following is same as the above command:

    rofi -modi "run#ssh" -show run

The modi to combine in combi mode.
For syntax to `-combi-modi`, see `-modi`.
To get one merge view, of `window`,`run`, and `ssh`:

    rofi -show combi -combi-modi "window,run,ssh" -modi combi

## Configuration

Generate a default configuration file
```
mkdir -p ~/.config/rofi
rofi -dump-config > ~/.config/rofi/config.rasi
```

This creates a file called `config.rasi` in the `~/.config/rofi/` folder, which is one of the default config file rofi checks for. You can modify this file to set configuration settings and modify themes.

Please see the [configuration guide](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi/blob/next/CONFIG.md) for a summary of configuration options. More detailed options are provided in the manpages.

## Themes

Please see the [themes manpages](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi/blob/next/doc/rofi-theme.5.markdown) for a detailed description.
