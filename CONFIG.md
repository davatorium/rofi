## :exclamation: Upgrade from old configuration format to new :exclamation:

In release after '2 Jan 2020' you can convert to the new configuration format by using the following command:

```bash 
rofi -upgrade-config
```

This will create `~/.config/rofi/config.rasi` (or the default location for your system) with the previously configured options.

From 1.7.0 the old configuration format is no longer supported and the `-upgrade-config` option is no longer available.

<br />

# Where does the configuration live

Rofi's configurations, custom themes live in `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/rofi/`, on most systems this is `~/.config/rofi/`.

The name of the main configuration file is `config.rasi`. (`~/.config/rofi/config.rasi`).

# Create an empty configuration file

Open `~/.config/rofi/config.rasi` in your favorite text editor and add the following block:

```css
configuration {

}
```
You can now set the options in the `configuration` block. 

# Create a configuration file from current setup

If you do not want to start from scratch, or want to migrate from older configuration format, you can get tell rofi to dumps it configuration:

```bash
rofi -dump-config > ~/.config/rofi/config.rasi
```

This will have all the possible settings and their current value.
If a value is the default value, the entry will be commented.

For example:
```css
configuration {               
/*  modi: "window,run,ssh,drun";*/
/*  font: "mono 12";*/
/*  location: 0;*/
/*  yoffset: 0;*/
/*  xoffset: 0;*/
/*  fixed-num-lines: true;*/
... cut ...
/*  ml-row-down: "ScrollDown";*/                                                                                        
/*  me-select-entry: "MousePrimary";*/                                                                                  
/*  me-accept-entry: "MouseDPrimary";*/                                                                                 
/*  me-accept-custom: "Control+MouseDPrimary";*/ 
}
```

# Configuration file format

## Encoding

The encoding of the file is utf-8. Both Unix (`\n`) and windows (`\r\n`) newlines format are supported. But Unix is preferred.

## Comments

C and C++ file comments are supported.

* Anything after  `// ` and before a newline is considered a comment.
* Everything between `/*` and `*/` is a comment.

Comments can be nested and the C comments can be inline.

The following is valid:

```
// Magic comment.
property: /* comment */ value;
```

However, this is not:

```
prop/*comment*/erty: value;
```

## White space

White space and newlines, like comments, are ignored by the parser.

This:

```
property: name;
```

Is identical to:

```
     property             :
name

;
```

## Data types

**ROFI**'s configuration supports several data formats:

### String

A string is always surrounded by double quotes (`"`). Between the quotes there can be any printable character.

For example:

```css

 ml-row-down: "ScrollDown";
```

### Number

An integer may contain any full number.
                                  
For example:                     
                                  
```                               
eh: 2;                        
```                               

### Boolean

Boolean value is either `true` or `false`. This is case-sensitive.

For example:

```css
show-icons: true;
```

This is equal to the `-show-icons` option on the commandline, and `show-icons: false;` is equal to `-no-show-icons`.

### Character

Character value is always surrounded by single quotes (') and should contain a single character.
It supports escaping.

```css
matching-negate-char: '-';
```

### List

This is not supported by the old configuration system, but can be used in the **rasi** format.

A list starts with a '[' and ends with a ']'. The entries in the list are comma-separated.
The entry in the list single ASCII words.

```css
 combi-modi: [window,drun];
```
For older versions you have :

```css
 combi-modi: "window,drun";
```

# Get a list of all possible options

There are 2 ways to get a list of all options:

1. Dump the configuration file explained above. (`rofi -dump-config`)
2. Look at output of `rofi -h`.

To see what values an option support check the manpage, it describes most of them.

NOTE: not all options might be in the manpage, as options can be added at run-time. (f.e. by plugins).


# Splitting configuration over multiple files

It is possible to split configuration over multiple files using imports. For example in `~/.config/rofi/config.rasi`

```css
configuration {
}
@import "myConfig"
@theme "MyTheme"

```

Rofi will first parse the config block in `~/.config/rofi/config.rasi`, then parse `~/.config/rofi/myConfig.rasi` and then load the theme `myTheme`.\
More information can be obtained from **Themes** section\
Imports can be nested.
